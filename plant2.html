    <p style="font-family: serif;"> Elm leafs are extremely common, making it pretty hard for them to stand out; however, Elm leafs do have a distinct pointed shape, making them easy to spot. Elm leafs on paper are really cool! However, their oversaturation makes them a lot less exciting than you'd think. Acoustic guitarists and elm leafs are a lot alike, very cool! However, not all are super unique. It used to mean something to be an elm leaf! Now, suddenly, everyone is an elm leaf. It's hard to spot who’s really worth their elm leaf coolness, and who's riding off the others' succes.</p>
