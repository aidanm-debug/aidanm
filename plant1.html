    <p style="font-family: serif;"> Anthistiriinae is a species of grass in the “Poaceae” family. its family includes many other large forms of grass like wheat, cereal and bamboo which are often cultivated intentionally by farmers. This strand of Anthistiriinae called  is however not intentionally cultivated and is actually quite invasive and purposeless. Anthistiriinae and many electric guitar players have a lot in common!!!. Sure some Anthistiriinae is cool, however most of the time the Anthistiriinae doesn't understand it dosent need to be in EVERY environment. Anthistiriinae does not however seem to understand this and will make sure you know how great it is and how inferior you are very condescendingly! The worst part is once one Anthistiriinae is made aware of a lack of Anthistiriinae they all will follow!!
