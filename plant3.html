    <p style="font-family: serif;"> In a world of social climbing and manufactured coolness the Yuccas keep it real. While all the other plants do their best to grow far off the ground the Yucca plant stays grounded and humble resting its leafs on the dirt bellow it and never growing more then 2 feet off the ground. Yuccas are stoic and quiet being able to last months without water all with no complaints while enjoying their grounded habitat. Yuccas are eccentric plants while their large spikey leafs may seem like a little much when you get to them they are as lovable as can be. Every banjo player ive met is alot like a yucca, theirs something to be said about choosing the banjo as your primary instrument, as banjos arent really super mainstream or seen you can assure a banjo player has a real passion for their instrument. Yuccas and banjo players are eccentric individuals they might like some music some people see as weird or different but, what others thought never mattered to them anyways.</p>
